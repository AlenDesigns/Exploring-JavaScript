/*

Terms:

- Operand - Value operator is applied to
  5 + 2 - 5 and 2 are the operands
- Unary operator - operator assigned to a single operand
  -5 -> - is an unary operator and 5 is the operand
 Binary operator - operator assigned to 2 operands
  3 - 1 -> - is a binary operator and 3, 1 are operands

//Binary +

*/

let name = "Rich" + ' ' + "Mery";
let myString = 1 + "2";  // if + detects a string, it converts all operands to string
myString = 1 + 1 + "2"; // operations are evaluated from left to right - 22

// All other operators, except binary +, convert to numbers
let age = "21" -1;
let days = 12 * "30";
let randomCalculation = 12 / "2" + 1;

//console.log(randomCalculation);


// Unary +

let underage = true;
//console.log(+underage); // -> 1 + converting booloean value to a number

let x = "30";
let y = "20";

//console.log(+x + +y);

//Remainder Operator - %

//console.log(5 % 2);
//console.log(6 % 3);

//Exponentiation operator

console.log(2 ** 2);
console.log(3 ** 2);
console.log(4 ** 3);
console.log(8 ** (1/3) ); // 8 to the power of 3 i.e. 2x2x2 = 8
